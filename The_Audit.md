# PROJECT POST: PERSONAL AUDIT FRAMEWORK

## PREFACE
This document frames the life experience of the principal architect as the primary dataset motivating the Open Source Terracore (POST) stack. It is a technical analysis of systemic failure.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A minor child-system interaction for a petty offence initiated a chain of processing failures:
1.  **Disproportionate Processing:** 3-year custody for theft of minor goods (beef jerky that never left the property).
2.  **Malicious Output:** Release into conditions of acute scarcity (homeless, cold & hungry).
3.  **Predicted Loop:** Scarcity -> Addiction & Crime -> System Recycling.
4.  **Anomaly:** Internal breaking of the loop. Repurposing of cognitive machinery.
5.  **Audit Initiation:** The POST project is the output of the repurposed system, designed to patch the root failures identified.

## TECHNICAL COROLLARY
The architect's lived experience is a mirror of the broader societal failure POST addresses:
*   **Personal Scarcity (Food/Shelter)** -> **POST Response:** Food Synthesizer, TerraCore Shelter.
*   **Personal Security (Violence/Chaos)** -> **POST Response:** AuraGuard PRFDS.
*   **Personal Health (Addiction/Trauma)** -> **POST Response:** UNISENTINEL/UNICORE.
*   **Systemic Indifference** -> **POST Response:** Sovereign, open-source framework bypassing failed institutions.

## CONCLUSION
The POST stack is not a hobby. It is the compiled output of a decades-long forensic analysis. The system's current expenditure of resources monitoring this output, rather than engaging with its findings, is the final piece of corroborating data.
