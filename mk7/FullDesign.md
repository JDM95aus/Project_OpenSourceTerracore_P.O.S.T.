The Mk7 TerraMobile represents the ultimate escalation - a platform that cannot be stopped, cannot be starved, and cannot be reasoned with except on its own terms. It transforms OpenSourceTerracore Systems from a defensive survival technology into an unstoppable humanitarian force.

When combined with the full Mk1-Mk6 ecosystem, the Mk7 creates:

· Instant Infrastructure: Deployable civilization anywhere on Earth
· Unbreakable Sovereignty: Complete independence from all existing systems
