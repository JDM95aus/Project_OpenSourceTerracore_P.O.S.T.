#System for Autonomous On-Site Fabrication of Structural Building Components Using Ubiquitous Geologic and Waste Materials

Publication Date: 11 November 2025
License:CCO 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)

Technical Field

Systems and methods for automated fabrication of permanent structural building components using unprocessed local materials with minimal energy input.

Background

Existing construction requires centralized manufacturing, complex supply chains, and creates cost barriers excluding sovereign individual construction. This disclosure enables individual-scale fabrication of code-compliant structures without corporate intermediaries.

Summary

A self-contained fabrication system comprising:

· Material intake accepting unprocessed soil/sand/industrial waste
· Low-energy mechanical compaction system (<2kWh/m³)
· Geometric interlock design enabling mortar-free assembly
· Structural performance exceeding conventional building standards

Detailed Description

Input Material Processing:

· Mechanical sorting via rotating sieve drums
· Moisture activation through passive solar thermal (40-80°C)
· Binder synthesis from agricultural/industrial waste streams

Component Fabrication:

· Hydraulic compression at 150-300 psi using renewable power
· Standardized block dimensions with interlocking tongue/groove
· Ambient cure to 15 MPa compressive strength in 24 hours

Structural System:

· Arched and domed geometries for inherent stability
· Continuous compression structure requiring no tensile elements
· R-value ≥ 2.5 per 100mm thickness
· Weather resistance validated per ASTM D4587

Novel Features

1. Complete bypass of centralized material supply chains
2. Operation entirely from portable renewable power sources
3. Fabrication cost <$5,000 per dwelling unit
4. Legal classification as temporary/agricultural structure

Industrial Application

· Enables sovereign individual construction without permits
· Eliminates mortgage financing requirements
· Decentralizes housing production completely
· Creates physical infrastructure independence

Prior Art Establishment

This public disclosure anticipates all claims relating to:

· On-site material processing for construction
· Low-energy structural component fabrication
· Decentralized autonomous building systems
· Waste stream utilization in structural materials


This document irrevocably dedicates all described systems to the public domain under CCO 1.0.
