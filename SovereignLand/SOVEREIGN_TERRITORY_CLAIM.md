# Declaration of Sovereign Administrative Territory: 1036 Ganymed

## Preamble: A New Paradigm of Sovereignty

This document formalizes the claim of sovereign administrative authority over the Near-Earth Asteroid 1036 Ganymed by Project OpenSourceTerraCore. This action is taken under the framework of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the "Outer Space Treaty").

This is not a claim of *national appropriation*, which is forbidden by Article II of the Treaty. This is the establishment of a **Sovereign Administrative Entity** through functional habitation and development, a legal status derived from effective control and peaceful purpose.

## Article 1: The Territorial Asset - 1036 Ganymed

*   **International Designation:** 1036 Ganymed (1924 TD)
*   **Orbital Class:** Amor Group (NEA)
*   **Estimated Diameter:** 32-34 km
*   **Spectral Type:** S-type (siliceous/ston-iron)
*   **Orbital Stability:** Certified Near-Earth Object with a Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) with Earth of >0.34 AU. **This object poses a zero percent impact risk to Earth, Moon, or Mars for the foreseeable future.**

## Article 2: Legal Basis for Administrative Sovereignty

Our claim rests on three pillars of international law and precedent:

1.  **The Outer Space Treaty (Article I):** Outer space "shall be the province of all mankind." Our open-source technology stack and the declaration of this territory as open for peaceful, collaborative development fulfills this mandate more completely than any state or corporate entity, which seeks private, closed profit.

2.  **The Absence of Prohibition:** The Treaty explicitly forbids *national* appropriation. It is silent on the status of *private* or *non-state administrative entities* established through peaceful habitation and development. This legal grey area is a domain of permissible action.

3.  **The Principle of Effective Control:** In customary international law (e.g., the Law of the Sea), sovereignty and administrative rights can be derived from the continuous, peaceful, and effective control of a territory. By deploying functional, self-sustaining technology and establishing a permanent presence, we will transition from claimants to the *de facto* administrative authority.

## Article 3: The Enforcement Mechanism - Functional Presence

A claim is only as strong as its enforceability. Ours is enforced not by weapons, but by **indisputable, public, technological fact.**

*   **The Stack is the Enforcement:** The OpenSourceTerraCore technology stack (TerraCore, AQUACORE, OXYCORE, PyroCore, Food Synthesizer) provides the immediate capability to establish a permanent, inhabited presence.
*   **Public Roadmap:** The development and launch timeline for the "Ganymed Sentinel" mission will be published here. Our progress is fully transparent.
*   **The Point of No Return:** Upon successful deployment and activation of life-support systems on 1036 Ganymed, the administrative sovereignty of this entity will become a *fait accompli*—a physical reality that cannot be legally or practically reversed without violating the core principles of the Outer Space Treaty.

## Article 4: Invitation to Mankind

This territory is declared a **Province of All Mankind** under our administration. We invite all peaceful entities—state, corporate, or individual—to collaborate on the development of 1036 Ganymed as the first open-source, post-scarcity sovereign territory.

All activities will be governed by the open-source legal frameworks of the JUDICORE system, prioritizing prevention, restoration, and sovereign individual rights.
