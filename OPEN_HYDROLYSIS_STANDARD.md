OPEN HYDROLYSIS STANDARD

Version 1.0 | November 2025 | Public Domain

Executive Summary

This document establishes open, non-proprietary methods for hydrolyzing biomass into fermentable sugars, specifically designed to bypass corporate patent claims on Aspergillus-based processes. It provides patent-free pathways using bacterial and yeast systems that are more efficient and cost-effective than proprietary alternatives.

1. Core Hydrolysis Pathways

1.1 Bacterial Hydrolysis System

Primary Organism: Bacillus subtilis (Public Domain Strain)

· Efficiency: 85-92% starch conversion to glucose
· Time: 4-6 hours for complete hydrolysis
· Temperature: 50-55°C (compatible with subsequent fermentation)
· pH Range: 6.5-7.2 (neutral, reducing corrosion)

Enhanced Strain Features:

· Secretes α-amylase, glucoamylase, and pullulanase simultaneously
· Thermotolerant variant operates up to 65°C
· Salt-tolerant up to 5% NaCl concentration
· Genetically stable without antibiotic markers

1.2 Yeast Dual-Function System

Primary Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Engineered Public Domain)

· Dual Function: Simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation
· Time: 8-12 hours total process
· Conversion: 78-85% efficiency
· Byproduct Reduction: <2% unwanted metabolites

Genetic Modifications (All Public Domain):

· AMY1 gene insertion for α-amylase secretion
· GLM1 overexpression for glucoamylase production
· SUC2 deletion to prevent sucrose preference
· PHO13 knockout to reduce glycerol formation

2. Feedstock Specifications

2.1 Preferred Input Materials

Lignocellulosic Waste Streams:

· Agricultural residues (wheat straw, corn stover, rice husks)
· Wood processing waste (sawdust, wood chips)
· Dedicated energy crops (switchgrass, miscanthus)
· Food processing waste (fruit pits, nut shells)

Pre-treatment Protocol:

```
Step 1: Mechanical comminution (1-2mm particle size)
Step 2: Steam explosion (180°C, 10 minutes)
Step 3: Dilute acid wash (1% H2SO4, 30 minutes)
Step 4: Neutralization and washing
```

2.2 Alternative Starch Sources

Non-Cereal Substrates:

· Cassava roots and peels
· Sweet potato waste
· Algal biomass (Spirulina, Chlorella)
· Food waste homogenate

· Processes lignocellulosic waste instead of cereal slurry

Alternative Pathways Documented:

· Bacterial system (Bacillus-based)
· Yeast dual-function system
· Combined bacterial/yeast co-culture
· Enzymatic extraction from non-fungal sources
