**Bringing Post-Scarcity through Open-Source Technology**

Welcome to the project repository for Project OpenSourceTerraCore (P.O.S.T) Food synthesizer and decentralizaion project, the world's first open-source Human OS for integrated food, energy, and material synthesizer.
## 👀 [Full_Index](https://github.com/JDM95aus/Project_OpenSourceTerracore_P.O.S.T./blob/main/Full_Index.md)


## 🚀 The Vision

A future where life's essentials are not commodities, but accessible utilities. (P.O.S.T) is a foundational step toward that future—a modular, open-hardware platform designed for local production and global resilience.

## 🔧 The Technology 
[Food Synthesizer](https://github.com/JDM95aus/Project_OpenSourceTerracore_P.O.S.T.-Scarcity-Money-Greed/blob/main/P_O_S_T_FoodSynthesizer.md) - The complete architectural and operational specification.

[Validation](https://github.com/JDM95aus/Project_OpenSourceTerracore_P.O.S.T.-Scarcity-Money-Greed/blob/main/Validation.md) - The Connection Between The Theory and Published Studies

The P.O.S.T Food Synthesizer integrates three core systems into a single, cohesive unit:

- Gasifier: Converts biomass and waste plastics into usable syngas.
- 3D Printer: Uses the syngas and novel mycelium-based cartridges to print objects and structures.
- Biosynth Module: Cultivates and processes mycelium for everything from construction materials to nutrient-rich biomass.

This is not just a machine; it's a **new industrial paradigm**.


## ⚔️ Weapon Detection System
[AUROGUARD](https://github.com/JDM95aus/Project_OpenSourceTerracore_P.O.S.T./blob/main/CrimePrevention/AuraGuard-WeaponDetection.md)
10m Weapon Detection from ambient RF signals


## 🎗️ Complete Cancer Cure Platform

## 🛠️ For Engineers & Makers

This project lives and dies by its community. We need:
- **Prototype Builders** to test the designs.
- **Electrical Engineers** to refine the PCBs.
- **Materials Scientists** to improve the biosynth substrates.
- **Code Contributors** to enhance the firmware.

**If you have cloned this repo, you are already part of the team.** Check the [Issues](https://github.com/JDM95aus/OpenSourceTerraCore/issues) to see where help is needed.

## **An Invitation to Builders**

The theoretical work is complete. The practical work begins now. This is a call to the engineers, the tinkerers, and the visionaries who don't just imagine a better world—they build it.

**Let's build it together.**

# *"The old system's agents show up, tools in hand, ready to engage in their game of extraction and transaction....... only to find there's nothing to extract, As the very concept of a "transaction" is meaningless here. All they can do is either walk away confused, or, in a moment of startling clarity, drop the tools and contribute something real."*


# **update**:
January 2nd. it's sad to see that after so much time being public, where stuck on the "We have no narrative for you that fits our models. So we will not engage with the evidence." loophole that prevents any true innovations, to them it may seem beurocratic but it's harmful to humanity. how many lives have to suffer before you publicly debate or accept the answer to the problems you claim to want to solve, either do what you claim or drop the act entirely, it's getting old, I refuse to become Nikolas Tesla, what a sad end to such a brilliant mind, imagine if he was discovered in his early age, imagine if he was given funding and access to the equipment he could not access, no, this is not my fate, I am here to force the evolution of humanity, for far too long we have been led by Greed alone, it's time to break the possibly 10000 year old tradition of primative hierarchy. no other species let the weak lead the pack, why do we? we blindly follow leaders who are blindly following bribes under a disguise of 'donations', they do it right in front of our eyes and don't even bother to hide the evidence any more, I released the AuraGuard design to all relevent agencies of the Australian government just 4 days after the Bondi attack in December, a technology that can literally protect against this exact threat, and im still yet to get any communication from them, they use Google and Facebook bots to hide there IP addresses failing to account for the fact there's only 1 inventor watching 24/7, I can link the times up and find the discrepancies very easily, it destroys ALL confidence I have in the government agencies, they let terrorists plan activity within there border, knowing the father was a threat and had a gun licence (is that not insane? how the he'll did a known extremist have a gun licence???) then at the same time they 'monitor' pre-validated technology that can save almost 100k lives around the globe DAILY and refuse to help verify it or acknowledge it in any way even though I've gone through every legitimate channel there is, either my criminal record (which is only proof of there failures) or my homelessness somehow Equals to (pre-validated and physically sound technology) must be fake... therefore ignore and monitor for extremist activity, instead realising that I am pro-life and every thing I do is made public due to the open source nature of it in the first place.... so yea, as I said, it's sad to see where still stuck on the Nikolas Tesla re-enactment but hopefully we can bypass that soon, who knows, it might only take one person reading this to want the title of "first man to ever build an actual food synthesizer" to realise "shit, this won't cost f** all, he's posted the full text based blueprint? wow it's just basic parts, I'm going build this over the weekend with the kids as a little hobby to test it out", then he goes viral, I offer to hire him the minute the project gets any actual funding and we both end world hunger (multiple simulations ran with an estimate being just 10,500 devices would literally end world hunger across the globe, mass produced I expect the price to come to around $1000 per, so $10.5million is all it cost to end world hunger for everyone, to me that sounds cheap, if we all pitched in that's a few cents each, to end world hunger, what is wrong with you guys??? wake up and help me build this already, I'd be happy with sceptics poking holes that I could either point out the fix for or possibly create fixes for, that's positive, total silence though, that's just plain disgusting, it paints a very dark picture of humanity...
