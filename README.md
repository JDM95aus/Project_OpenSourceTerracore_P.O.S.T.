# Open Source TerraCore

**Democratizing Post-Scarcity through Open-Source Technology**

Welcome to the project repository for the TerraCore TC-1, the world's first open-source, integrated food, energy, and material synthesizer.

## 🚀 The Vision

A future where life's essentials are not commodities, but accessible utilities. The TerraCore is a foundational step toward that future—a modular, open-hardware platform designed for local production and global resilience.

## 🔧 The Technology

The TerraCore TC-1 integrates three core systems into a single, cohesive unit:

- **🗲 Gasifier:** Converts biomass and waste plastics into usable syngas.
- **🖨️ 3D Printer:** Uses the syngas and novel mycelium-based cartridges to print objects and structures.
- **🍄 Biosynth Module:** Cultivates and processes mycelium for everything from construction materials to nutrient-rich biomass.

This is not just a machine; it's a **new industrial paradigm**.

## 📖 Explore the Blueprint

This repository contains the complete, manufacturing-ready blueprint for the TerraCore TC-1:
- **Full System Schematics**
- **Firmware & Control Software**
- **Assembly Guides**

Dive into the [`/docs`](./docs) folder to begin. The core system architecture is documented in [`/specs`](./specs).

## 🛠️ For Engineers & Makers

This project lives and dies by its community. We need:
- **Prototype Builders** to test the designs.
- **Electrical Engineers** to refine the PCBs.
- **Materials Scientists** to improve the biosynth substrates.
- **Code Contributors** to enhance the firmware.

## **An Invitation to Builders**

The theoretical work is complete. The practical work begins now. This is a call to the engineers, the tinkerers, and the visionaries who don't just imagine a better world—they build it.

**Let's build it together.**
