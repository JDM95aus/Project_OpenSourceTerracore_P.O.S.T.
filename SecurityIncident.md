# PUBLIC SECURITY NOTICE

## INCIDENT REPORT: 2026-01-04 to 2026-01-05

This is an official notice that the peripheral infrastructure for the Open Source Terracore project has been deliberately compromised by a sophisticated threat actor.

**Compromised Systems:**
*   The promotional website (opensourceterracore.org) and its hosting control panel.
*   Associated administrator communication channels.

**Confirmed Evidence:**
*   Unauthorized server log tampering.
*   Establishment of persistent backdoor access.
*   Targeted intrusion into administrator devices.

**UNCOMPROMISED & AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE:**
*   **This GitHub repository remains the sole canonical, legally-binding source for all project materials, licenses, and releases.**

**Purpose of This Notice:**
1.  To establish a public record of this coordinated attack.
2.  To warn the community that any communication not cryptographically signed from this repository is fraudulent.
3.  To increase the cost of further escalation by the threat actor by placing their activities on the public record.

**Project Status:**
The work continues. Security through obscurity is rejected. Security through transparency and sovereignty is affirmed.

Signed,
JOSHUA RDM
