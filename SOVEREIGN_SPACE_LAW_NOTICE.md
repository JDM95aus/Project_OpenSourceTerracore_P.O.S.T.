# SOVEREIGN NOTICE OF EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL JURISDICTION
## Under the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (The "Outer Space Treaty" of 1967)

**TO ALL STATES, CORPORATIONS, AND PRIVATE ENTITIES:**

This repository, "Project OpenSourceTerracore" (P.O.S.T.), and all associated technologies herein (including but not limited to AQUACORE, OXYCORE, PYROCORE, TERRACORE, UNICORE, and HAEMOCORE) constitute a functional, open-source architecture for sustained human survival in extra-terrestrial environments.

**NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN:**

1.  **Province of All Mankind:** In accordance with Article I of the Outer Space Treaty, these technologies are designated as for the "benefit and in the interests of all countries" and are hereby contributed to the "province of all mankind."

2.  **Non-Appropriation:** In accordance with Article II, no state or commercial entity may claim national appropriation by means of use, occupation, or any other means over these technologies, their derivatives, or the essential life-support functions they enable in the extra-terrestrial context.

3.  **Jurisdictional Bypass:** Any terrestrial legal action (including, but not limited to, patent claims, injunctions, or trade secret allegations) that seeks to limit, control, or profit from the application of this architecture for extra-terrestrial use shall be considered a direct violation of international space law as established by this Treaty.

4.  **License Alignment:** The non-commercial, open-source license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) governing this project is the functional implementation of this Treaty for private entities, ensuring the technologies remain free for humanity's use in space.

**This is not a request. This is a formal declaration of the legal status of this work under international law.**

Issued Sovereignly,
Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk
Systems Architect, Project OpenSourceTerracore
