# PRIOR ART DISCLOSURE: Integration of Bulk Quantum Oscillation Materials into Decentralized Systems
## Disclosure Date: 11th Nov 2025
## Inventor: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk
## Prior Art For: All systems integrating Kondo insulators exhibiting bulk quantum oscillations into distributed energy, computing, and propulsion platforms.

### Core Innovation Claim
This disclosure establishes prior art for the application of materials exhibiting bulk quantum oscillations (e.g., YbB₁₂ as documented in *Chen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2025*) within the architectural framework of the Terracore technology stack, specifically for:

1.  Enhancing thermoelectric conversion efficiency in waste-to-energy systems (PyroCore Mk4) by utilizing the material's dual insulator/metal state to minimize resistive energy loss.
2.  Enabling rudimentary quantum coherence effects in room-temperature computing systems (Nexus-Core Mk6) by leveraging the material's bulk quantum behavior for novel qubit design and information processing.
3.  Advancing containment and control systems for compact fusion reactors (TerraMobile Mk7) by using the tunable bulk properties of such materials as dynamic magnetic confinement lenses.

### Technical Implementation Principles
- **Energy Systems:** Coupling the thermal output of a gasification reactor with a thermoelectric generator utilizing a bulk quantum oscillation material (BQOM) as the core conversion medium.
- **Computing Systems:** Architecting a neuromorphic computing cluster where BQOM components handle specific optimization and pattern-recognition tasks through controlled quantum-state manipulation.
- **Propulsion Systems:** Employing BQOM arrays to generate and modulate high-strength, oscillating magnetic fields for magneto-hydrodynamic and electrogravitic propulsion concepts.

### System Integration Claim
This prior art specifically covers the integration pathway:

### Legal Notice
This public disclosure establishes prior art invalidating any patent claims filed after this date covering the integration of materials exhibiting bulk quantum oscillations into decentralized, open-source systems for energy, computing, and propulsion.

**Note:** This disclosure is based on the synthesis of published fundamental research (Chen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2025) with the existing Terracore architectural blueprint. It protects the applied engineering pathway, not the underlying material science.
