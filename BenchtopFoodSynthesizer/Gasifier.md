CRITICAL: This establishes reference plane for entire build

TOOLS REQUIRED:
- Surface plate (granite or machined steel)
- Machinist's square (300mm)
- Height gauge or precision level
- Center punch
- Angle grinder with flap disc

PROCEDURE:
1. Place base plate on surface plate
2. Check flatness - mark high spots with marker
3. Grind high spots until <0.5mm variation across surface
4. Verify with straightedge - no visible gaps
5. Punch center point and 300mm diameter circle

ERROR RECOVERY:
- If warped >1mm: Heat with torch and clamp to flat surface until cool
- If surface pitted: Build up with weld and re-grind


Step 1.2: Chamber-to-Base Alignment


FIXTURE: Build temporary alignment jig from scrap wood/steel

JIG DESIGN:
- 400mm square base with 300mm diameter ring
- 4× adjustable clamps at 90° intervals
- Spirit level mounted centrally

ASSEMBLY SEQUENCE:
1. Position base plate on level surface
2. Place alignment jig centered on base
3. Insert reactor chamber into jig ring
4. Verify:
   - Chamber vertical within 1mm over 600mm height
   - 10mm equal gap around circumference
   - Square to base within 0.5°
5. Tack weld at 4 points (90° intervals)
6. Remove jig and verify chamber hasn't moved
7. Complete continuous weld in 4 segments (opposite sides)

[DIAGRAM: Weld sequence - 12-6 o'clock, then 3-9 o'clock, etc.]

ERROR RECOVERY:
- Chamber not square: Apply heat to opposite side and persuade with clamp
- Weld distortion: Weld in shorter segments, allow cooling between


PHASE 2: INTERNAL COMPONENT INSTALLATION

   - 10mm equal gap to chamber wall
   - Level within 1mm across diameter
4. Tack weld legs to base
5. Remove blocks and complete welds

[DIAGRAM: Grate positioning with spacer blocks]

ERROR RECOVERY:
- Grate not level: Shim with steel shims before welding

2. Apply flux to both steel and copper
3. Clamp assembly in position
4. Heat sequence:
   - Heat steel first until flux bubbles
   - Move heat to copper until flux flows
   - Apply filler to steel-copper interface
   - Capillary action should draw filler through joint
5. Cool naturally - DO NOT quench

[DIAGRAM: Heat movement pattern for brazing]

ERROR RECOVERY:
- Filler won't flow: More heat on steel, less on copper
- Joint leaks: Clean thoroughly and re-braze
- Overheating (blue steel): Stop, cool, clean, restart with less heat

- Over-compression: Remove and re-install with less tension


Step 4.2: Outer Casing Fabrication


FORMING METHOD: Brake press or hammer form

PROCEDURE:
1. Cut casing panels to size
2. Form bends in sequence to avoid stress
3. Trial fit before final welding
4. Weld casing seams in short segments
5. Verify 50mm air gap maintained throughout

[DIAGRAM-missing: Casing panel layout and bend sequence]

To achieve a stable temperature of ±0.5°C using a gasifier as a heat source, a secondary, highly controlled heat exchange and regulation system would be necessary. This system would involve:
A buffer tank or reservoir: To absorb the variable heat output from the gasifier.
A heat exchanger: To transfer the heat to the target process.
Advanced control systems: Including sensors, valves, and automated feedback loops (e.g., PID controllers) to precisely blend the heated fluid or air with a cooler medium, thereby achieving the desired stable temperature in a separate process loop. 
the gasifier can provide the raw thermal energy, but a dedicated, precision control system is required to achieve high-stability temperature control like ±0.5°C.



Of course. This is a classic engineering problem: bridging a high-variance heat source with a need for precision. Here is a detailed, actionable plan for a builder to create this system using backyard parts and Open Source Terracore software.

Project: "Hermes" Precision Thermal Regulator

Purpose: To tame a gasifier's variable heat output to a stable ±0.5°C for processes like the Terracore food synthesizer.


1. The Physical Build: Backyard Engineering

This system uses two separate water loops to isolate the "wild" gasifier heat from the "tame" process heat.

Components Needed:

· Gasifier Loop (The Wild Side):
  · Heat Source: Your gasifier, modified with a water jacket (a coil of copper or steel tubing wrapped around/inside the combustion chamber).
  · Circulation: A 12V DC water pump (common automotive or marine bilge pump).
  · Buffer Tank: A large, insulated metal vessel (e.g., an old electric water heater tank, a large air compressor tank). This is your thermal capacitor.
  · Pressure/Temperature Relief Valve: Essential for safety from the water heater tank.
  · Overflow/Expansion Tank: A simple plastic container.
· Process Loop (The Tame Side):
  · Heat Exchanger: A copper tube-in-tube design or a small plate heat exchanger (can be sourced from an old instant hot water heater).
  · Mixing Valve: A 3-way motorized mixing valve. This is the key component. (Salvage from a high-end domestic heating system or a broken commercial espresso machine).
  · Circulation: A second 12V DC water pump.
  · Process Heater: The final application (e.g., the heated platen or chamber of the Terracore synthesizer).
· Sensors:
  · DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensors (Multiple): Cheap, accurate (±0.5°C), and easy to interface with a microcontroller.
    · T1: Buffer Tank Temperature.
    · T2: Process Loop Outlet Temperature (THE CRITICAL SENSOR).
    · T3: Ambient/Cold Water Temperature.

                                                                   |

      |                                                            |
      +-----------[T2: Process Temp Sensor]------------------------+


How it Works Physically:

1. The Gasifier Loop runs continuously, pumping hot water through the buffer tank, heating it to a high temperature (e.g., 85-95°C).
2. The Process Loop pulls water from the buffer tank through the heat exchanger.
3. The 3-Way Motorized Mixing Valve blends this super-hot water with cold water from the return line.
4. The T2 Sensor measures the final temperature going to the process.
5. Based on T2's reading, the software adjusts the mixing valve to add more hot or cold water to maintain the exact setpoint.


2. The Software & Control Logic: Open Source Terracore

This is where the precision is achieved. The brain is a microcontroller (Arduino, ESP32) running a PID controller.

Core Logic: PID Control for the Mixing Valve

The software will run this algorithm:

1. Setpoint: The desired process temperature (e.g., 65.0°C).
2. Process Variable: The current reading from T2.
3. Control Variable: The position of the mixing valve (0% = full cold, 100% = full hot).

The PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller automatically calculates how much to move the valve to correct any error.

· Proportional: Reacts to the current error (e.g., if it's 2°C too cold, it starts opening the valve).
· Integral: Reacts to persistent error (e.g., if it's been 0.5°C too cold for a while, it nudges the valve a bit more).
· Derivative: Reacts to the rate of change (e.g., if the temperature is rising very fast, it closes the valve early to prevent overshoot).


3. Builder's Step-by-Step Plan

1. Assemble the Gasifier Loop:
   · Build the water jacket on your gasifier. Ensure all joints are secure.
   · Connect it to the buffer tank and DC Pump 1. Fill with water and test for leaks without heat.
2. Assemble the Process Loop:
   · Install the heat exchanger, DC Pump 2, and the motorized mixing valve.
   · Connect the T2 sensor right at the outlet going to your process.
   · Connect this loop to the buffer tank and your final device (e.g., synthesizer platen).
3. Wire the Electronics:
   · Connect all DS18B20 sensors to the microcontroller.
   · Connect the motorized mixing valve (it likely has a simple 3-wire connection: power, ground, signal).
   · Connect the two DC pumps to relays or MOSFETs controlled by the microcontroller.
4. Software Setup:
   · Flash the Terracore firmware with the PID control module onto your microcontroller.
   · Calibrate the PID values (Kp, Ki, Kd). This is the "tuning" process:
     · Start with Kp only, set Ki and Kd to zero.
     · Increase Kp until the system starts to oscillate (temperature swings above and below the setpoint), then reduce it by half.
     · Then, slowly increase Ki to eliminate any long-term drift.
     · Finally, increase Kd to dampen oscillations and prevent overshoot.
5. Test and Iterate:
   · Start the gasifier. Let the buffer tank heat up.
   · Activate the Process Loop and the PID controller.
   · Watch the T2 sensor log and adjust PID values until the temperature holds rock-steady at the setpoint.

By following this plan, a builder uses the gasifier as a brute-force heat generator and delegates the precision to a separate, smart mechanical and software system. This is a robust, achievable path to high-stability thermal control from highly variable sources.
